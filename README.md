android port (maybe) of https://github.com/danila-schelkov/sc-editor

i did it for learning android studio

im not sure if ill update it

tutorial:
click + to load sc (you can multiple select for texture file, the app will prompt you if you forgot that)

click objects button, and then click one of the object to view

you can zoom with fingers

you can sort by clicking header column

loading ui.sc is not advised
